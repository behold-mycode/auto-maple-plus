# Auto Maple

Auto Maple is a Python program that plays MapleStory, a 2D side-scrolling MMORPG, using 
simulated key presses, TensorFlow machine learning, template matching, and other computer 
vision techniques.

### Command Books
Designed with modularity in mind, Auto Maple can operate any character
in the game as long as it is provided with an appropriate list of in-game actions, or a
"command book". A command book is a Python file that contains multiple classes, one for 
each in-game ability, that tells the bot what keys it should press and when to press them.
