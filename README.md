# Auto Maple

Auto Maple is a Python program that plays MapleStory, a 2D side-scrolling MMORPG, using 
simulated key presses, TensorFlow machine learning, template matching, and other computer 
vision techniques. Designed with modularity in mind, Auto Maple can operate any character
in the game as long as it is provided with an appropriate list of in-game actions, or a
"command book".
